# Tysite (Webpack edition)
This site implements three key features:

### Prerendering
Makes the site:
  - As they say, *blazing fast* on first page load ðŸ”¥
  - Usuable with JavaScript disabled in the browser

### Push state routing
Makes the site:
  - More efficient because all resources are not reloaded on page load
  - Smoother because there is no flash of white as the page reloads on navigation

### Code splitting
Makes the site:
  - Leaner because resources are only loaded as they are needed
  - Intelligent because shared resources are only loaded once across the site

## Why not just use something like Gatsby or VuePress?
  - There's merit to reengineering your favorite projects to learn
  - Enjoy the killer features of other libraries with substantially fewer dependencies
  - Write your JavaScript how you want instead of working within a framework
