# Tysite (Webpack edition)
Reengineering the best features of Gatsby without React.

## Features
#### Prerendering
An SPA without the drawbacks of an SPA:
  - Understandable to search engine crawlers (yay, SEO)
  - Usuable with JavaScript disabled in the browser
  - As they say, *blazing fast* on first page load ðŸ”¥

#### Push state routing
Navigation using native browser APIs:
  - Avoids loading all resources each page needs on each navigation
  - Removes flash of white as the page reloads on navigation

#### Code splitting
Loads only what you need when you need it:
  - Fewer overall network requests == less bandwidth used
  - Shared resources only loaded once across the site

## Why not just use something like Gatsby or VuePress?
  - Understand how other projects work by building your own
  - Enjoy killer features other projects offer with substantially fewer dependencies
  - Write your JavaScript how you want instead of working within a framework
